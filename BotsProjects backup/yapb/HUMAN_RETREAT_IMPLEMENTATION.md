# YaPB Human Retreat Behavior Implementation ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive human retreat behavior to make human bots actively flee from zombie threats, addressing the user's concern that "humans still don't fucking retreat from zombies."

## 🏃‍♂️ **Human Retreat Features Added:**

### 1. **Enhanced `reactOnEnemy()` - Immediate Retreat Response**
**Location**: `src/botlib.cpp` lines ~2420-2450

**Behavior**:
- **Zombie Detection**: Humans detect zombies via `m_isCreature` flag or model name containing "zo"
- **Retreat Distance**: Humans retreat when zombies get within 80% of `cv_zombie_hunt_range`
- **Forced Task Switching**: Immediately switches to `Task::SeekCover` when zombies approach
- **Backwards Movement**: Forces humans to move backwards at full speed when zombies are very close (<300 units)
- **Attack Suppression**: Sets `m_isEnemyReachable = false` to prevent attacking while retreating

### 2. **Enhanced `filterTasks()` - Prioritized Retreat Logic**
**Location**: `src/botlib.cpp` lines ~2074-2098

**Behavior**:
- **Maximum Seek Cover Desire**: Humans get `TaskPri::SeekCover` (maximum priority) when zombies are close
- **Hunt Suppression**: Completely removes hunt desire (`huntEnemyDesire = 0.0f`) when zombies detected
- **Range-Based Scaling**: Reduces retreat priority at medium distances but still prioritizes safety
- **Logic Override**: Completely skips normal task logic when zombies are present

### 3. **Enhanced `attackMovement()` - Combat Retreat Behavior**
**Location**: `src/combat.cpp` lines ~1439-1465

**Behavior**:
- **Immediate Retreat Movement**: Forces `m_moveSpeed = -pev->maxspeed` (full backward speed)
- **Strafe Fighting**: Sets `m_fightStyle = Fight::Strafe` for evasive movement
- **Extended Retreat Time**: Sets `m_retreatTime = game.time() + 3.0f` for sustained retreat
- **Task Override**: Forces `Task::SeekCover` during combat with zombies
- **Logic Skip**: Completely bypasses normal attack movement when retreating from zombies

## 🎯 **Expected Human Behavior Changes:**

### **Before Enhancement:**
- Humans would fight zombies like normal enemies
- No special retreat behavior
- Would often get cornered and killed by zombies

### **After Enhancement:**
- **Immediate Retreat**: Humans start retreating as soon as zombies get within ~820 units (80% of default hunt range)
- **Backwards Movement**: Humans move backwards at full speed when zombies are close
- **Task Prioritization**: Seeking cover becomes the #1 priority over all other tasks
- **No Aggressive Pursuit**: Humans won't chase zombies, only retreat and defend
- **Sustained Evasion**: Retreat behavior lasts for 2-3 seconds to ensure escape

## ⚙️ **Configuration Integration:**

The human retreat behavior scales with the zombie ConVars:
- `cv_zombie_hunt_range`: Determines retreat detection distance
- `cv_zombie_aggression_level`: (Future) Could scale human fear response
- `cv_zombie_update_frequency`: (Future) Could affect retreat response time

## 🔍 **Zombie Detection Methods:**

1. **Bot-Based Detection**: Checks if enemy bot has `m_isCreature = true`
2. **Model-Based Detection**: Checks if model name contains "zo" substring
3. **Team Verification**: Ensures zombies are on opposite team

## 🎮 **Gameplay Impact:**

- **More Realistic Zombie Survival**: Humans now behave like actual survivors
- **Dynamic Cat-and-Mouse**: Creates tension between aggressive zombies and fleeing humans
- **Strategic Positioning**: Humans will seek defensible positions rather than direct confrontation
- **Balanced Difficulty**: Prevents zombies from being too overpowered while maintaining challenge

## 📋 **Testing Recommendations:**

1. **Retreat Distance Testing**: Verify humans start retreating at correct distances
2. **Movement Testing**: Confirm humans move backwards/strafe when zombies approach
3. **Task Priority Testing**: Ensure seek cover overrides other tasks properly
4. **Performance Testing**: Monitor for any performance impact with multiple humans retreating

## ✅ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

Human retreat behavior is now fully implemented and compiled successfully. Humans will actively flee from zombie threats, creating a much more realistic and engaging zombie survival experience.

**Build Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Files Modified**: `src/botlib.cpp`, `src/combat.cpp`  
**Compilation**: No errors  
**Deployment**: Ready for testing

---
The human retreat behavior implementation is complete. Humans should now properly flee from zombies as requested! 🧟‍♂️💨
