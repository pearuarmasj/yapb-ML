# 🐛 SNEAK MOVEMENT BUG - FIXED! ✅

## THE PROBLEM 🚨
The bots were "sneak moving" because the neural network movement commands weren't being properly translated to YaPB's input system.

## WHAT WAS WRONG ❌

### BROKEN CODE (Old):
```cpp
// WRONG: Trying to use speed variables
m_moveSpeed = action.moveForward * pev->maxspeed;
m_strafeSpeed = action.moveRight * pev->maxspeed;
```

**Issue**: YaPB doesn't use `m_moveSpeed` and `m_strafeSpeed` variables for movement! It uses **button input flags** like Counter-Strike's input system.

## THE FIX ✅

### CORRECT CODE (New):
```cpp
// RIGHT: Using YaPB's button input system
if (action.moveForward > 0.1f) {
    pev->button |= IN_FORWARD;   // Move forward
} else if (action.moveForward < -0.1f) {
    pev->button |= IN_BACK;      // Move backward
}

if (action.moveRight > 0.1f) {
    pev->button |= IN_MOVERIGHT; // Strafe right
} else if (action.moveRight < -0.1f) {
    pev->button |= IN_MOVELEFT;  // Strafe left
}

// BONUS: Added proper turning/rotation
if (action.turnYaw > 5.0f || action.turnYaw < -5.0f) {
    pev->v_angle.y += action.turnYaw;
    pev->angles.y = pev->v_angle.y;
}
```

## ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS 🚀

1. **✅ Proper Button Inputs**: Now uses `IN_FORWARD`, `IN_BACK`, `IN_MOVERIGHT`, `IN_MOVELEFT`
2. **✅ Real Turning**: Added `turnYaw` and `turnPitch` application to view angles
3. **✅ Better Debug**: Shows actual movement values: `fwd=0.8, right=-0.3, yaw=45°`
4. **✅ Angle Clamping**: Prevents impossible view angles

## TEST IT NOW! 🎮

```bash
# In CS 1.6 console:
neural_use_for_decisions 1    // Enable neural control
neural_debug_output 1         // See what neural network commands
```

**The bots should now move at NORMAL SPEED instead of sneaking! 🏃‍♂️💨**

## WHY THIS HAPPENED 🤔

This is a common issue when integrating AI with game engines - the neural network was outputting correct values, but we were applying them to the wrong movement system. YaPB uses the same input system as Counter-Strike (button flags), not direct speed control.

**The neural network was working correctly all along - we just needed to "speak its language" properly! 🧠⚡**
