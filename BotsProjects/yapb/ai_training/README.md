# 🤖 CS 1.6 Proper ML Bot - The REAL Deal

**No more amateur neural network bullshit.** This is a professional machine learning implementation for Counter-Strike 1.6 bots using industry-standard frameworks.

## 🎯 What This Actually Does

- **Computer Vision**: Real-time screen capture with CNN processing
- **Memory Reading**: Direct game state via pymem (position, health, velocity)
- **Professional ML**: PyTorch + Stable-Baselines3 PPO algorithm
- **Gymnasium Environment**: Proper RL framework wrapper
- **Real Training**: The bot actually learns through proper reinforcement learning

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
setup.bat
```

### 2. Start CS 1.6
- Launch Counter-Strike 1.6
- Join **de_survivor** map
- Make sure you can move around

### 3. Train the Bot
```bash
# Full training (1M timesteps)
python train_ml_bot.py

# Test mode only
python train_ml_bot.py --test
```

### 4. Watch the Magic
The bot will learn to:
- Navigate the map
- Avoid zombies
- Survive longer
- Use proper movement patterns

## 📊 Technical Details

- 20 FPS continuous capture
- CNN processing for visual input

### Machine Learning
- **Algorithm**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Framework**: Stable-Baselines3
- **Neural Network**: Multi-input CNN policy
- **Training**: 1M timesteps default

### Action Space
7-dimensional continuous actions:
- Forward/backward movement
- Left/right strafe
- Mouse X/Y turning
- Jump
- Duck
- Shoot

### Observation Space
- **Image**: 128x128x3 RGB screen capture
- **Position**: (x, y, z) coordinates
- **Velocity**: (vx, vy, vz) movement vector
- **Health**: Current health (0-100)

## 🛠️ Dependencies

### Core ML Stack
- `torch` - PyTorch for neural networks
- `stable-baselines3` - Professional RL algorithms
- `gymnasium` - Standard RL environment interface

### Game Integration
- `pymem` - Memory reading from CS 1.6
- `pywin32` - Windows API for screen capture
- `opencv-python` - Image processing
- `psutil` - Process monitoring

### Data & Monitoring
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization
- `tensorboard` - Training monitoring

## 🎮 Supported CS 1.6 Versions

Primary target: **CS 1.6 build 6153** (most common)

Memory offsets included for:
- Steam version
- WON version  
- Various builds

Auto-detection attempts multiple process names:
- `hl.exe` (Half-Life/CS)
- `cstrike.exe` (Counter-Strike)
- `hlds.exe` (Dedicated server)

## 🗺️ Maps

**Primary target**: `de_survivor` (zombie survival)

The bot learns to:
- Navigate zombie survival scenarios
- Manage resources (health, ammo)
- Survive as long as possible
- Develop survival strategies

## 📈 Training Progress

Monitor training with TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir tensorboard_logs/
```

Key metrics:
- **Episode reward**: Survival score
- **Episode length**: How long bot survives
- **Mean reward**: Average performance
- **Loss**: Neural network training loss

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CS 1.6 Not Found
- Make sure CS 1.6 is running
- Try different process names
- Run as administrator

### Memory Reading Fails
- Update memory offsets for your CS version
- Use `offset_finder.py` to discover new offsets
- Check antivirus interference

### Screen Capture Issues
- Ensure CS 1.6 window is visible
- Check Windows permissions
- Try windowed mode instead of fullscreen

### Training Slow
- Enable GPU acceleration: `pip install torch[cuda]`
- Reduce image size in environment
- Lower training FPS

## 🎯 Performance Expectations

### Training Time
- **CPU**: ~24 hours for 1M timesteps
- **RTX 4080**: ~6-8 hours for 1M timesteps
- **Progress**: Visible improvement after ~100k steps

### Bot Performance
After training, the bot should:
- Survive 2-3x longer than random actions
- Navigate maps intelligently
- Show tactical behavior
- Adapt to different scenarios

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Custom Maps
Edit `CS16Environment` to support other maps:
```python
# Change reward function for different objectives
def _calculate_reward(self, observation):
    # Custom reward logic here
    pass
```

### Different Game Modes
Modify action space for:
- Deathmatch (focus on combat)
- Defusal (objective-based)
- Hostage rescue (team coordination)

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Adjust in `train_cs16_ml_bot()`:
```python
model = PPO(
    learning_rate=3e-4,    # Learning speed
    n_steps=2048,          # Steps per rollout
    batch_size=64,         # Training batch size
    # ... other parameters
)
```

## 🏆 Success Metrics

The bot is working when you see:
- ✅ Consistent positive rewards
- ✅ Increasing episode lengths
- ✅ Intelligent movement patterns
- ✅ Survival improvements over time

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a complete, working ML system. No more:
- ❌ Amateur neural networks

- Visual input (what it sees)
- Game state (where it is)
- Reinforcement learning (trial and error)
- Professional ML algorithms

No bullshit. Just real machine learning.
