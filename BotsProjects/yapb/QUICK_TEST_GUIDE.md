# ðŸ§  PURE NEURAL AI - QUICK TEST GUIDE

## Setup Complete âœ…
- Pure Neural AI yapb.dll deployed to: `F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Half-Life\cstrike\addons\yapb\bin\yapb.dll`
- Build timestamp: June 13, 2025 10:36 PM
- Size: 803KB

## Testing Steps

### 1. Launch CS 1.6
- Start Counter-Strike 1.6
- Open console (~)

### 2. Setup Test Server
```
map de_survivor
sv_cheats 1
mp_startmoney 16000
mp_buytime 9999
mp_roundtime 10
```

### 3. Add Neural Bots (Start as Idiots)
```
yapb add
yapb add
```

### 4. Enable Pure Neural System
```
pure_neural_enabled 1
pure_neural_debug 1
neural_use_for_decisions 1
```

### 5. Watch the Learning Process

**What to Expect:**
- ðŸ¤– Bots start as **COMPLETE IDIOTS**
- ðŸ§± They run into walls constantly
- ðŸŽ¯ Random movement and actions
- ðŸ’€ They die a lot (learning through pain)
- ðŸ“ˆ **GRADUALLY get better** over rounds
- ðŸ§  Debug messages show learning progress

**Sample Debug Output:**
```
ðŸ¤– Bot 'Player' now has a neural brain - Starting as complete idiot!
ðŸ§  PURE NEURAL SYSTEM: 2 bots learning through pain!
```

### 6. Monitor Learning
- Watch for ~10-20 rounds
- Bots should slowly learn to navigate
- Less wall-running, better movement
- **NO YaPB intelligence used!**

## Console Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pure_neural_enabled 1` | Enable pure neural system |
| `pure_neural_debug 1` | Show learning debug output |
| `neural_use_for_decisions 1` | Use neural for all decisions |
| `yapb add` | Add a neural bot |
| `yapb remove` | Remove a bot |
| `yapb list` | List all bots |

## Expected Behavior

### Round 1-5: **COMPLETE IDIOTS**
- Running into walls
- Random spinning
- Falling off ledges
- Instant deaths

### Round 6-15: **SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT**
- Less wall collisions
- Basic forward movement
- Still very stupid

### Round 16+: **LEARNING VISIBLE**
- Better navigation
- Avoiding obvious deaths
- Still not smart, but improving

## Success Criteria
âœ… Bots spawn and show "neural brain" message
âœ… Debug output shows "PURE NEURAL SYSTEM"
âœ… Bots act like idiots initially
âœ… Gradual improvement over rounds
âœ… NO YaPB pathfinding used

## Troubleshooting
- If bots act too smart â†’ Neural system not active
- If no debug messages â†’ Check console commands
- If crashes â†’ Check dll compatibility
